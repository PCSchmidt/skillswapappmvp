## Project Status

âœ… **Phase 9: Testing & Optimization Complete**

## Quick Start

To prepare for deployment after fixing ESLint dependency issues:

```bash
# On Windows
.\prepare_for_deployment.bat

# On Linux/Mac
./prepare_for_deployment.sh
```

## ESLint Dependency Fix

This project recently addressed an ESLint dependency conflict that caused Vercel build failures. The specific error was related to `@eslint/config-array@^3.0.0` not being found. 

The fix includes:
- Specifying exact versions for ESLint-related packages
- Adding dependency validation tools
- Updating build scripts with validation steps
- Creating documentation on the issue and solution

For more details, see [ESLint Dependency Fix Documentation](docs/eslint_dependency_fix.md).

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. Run the dependency validation to ensure compatibility:
   ```
   node scripts/validate-dependencies.js
   ```

2. Test the build process locally:
   ```
   # On Windows
   .\build.bat
   
   # On Linux/Mac 
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Set up Git pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):
   ```
   # On Windows
   .\pre-commit-hook-setup.bat
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   ./pre-commit-hook-setup.sh
   ```

4. Commit and push changes to the repository:
   ```
   git add package.json vercel.json docs/eslint_dependency_fix.md
   git commit -m "Fix ESLint dependency conflicts for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin dev
   ```

5. Monitor the Vercel build at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

6. Test the staging environment thoroughly

7. Deploy to production when staging is verified

For complete deployment steps, see [Deployment Verification Steps](docs/deployment_verification_steps.md).

## Project Structure

The SkillSwap MVP is a Next.js application with the following key components:

- `/src`: Application source code
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/docs`: Documentation
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts
- `/supabase`: Database migrations and functions
- `/tests`: Unit tests (Jest)
- `/cypress`: End-to-end tests (Cypress)

## Testing Infrastructure

SkillSwap includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

**Note:** Run `npm install` before executing any Jest or Cypress commands to ensure all dependencies are installed.

### Unit Testing (Jest)

Run unit tests with:
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only UI component tests
npm run test:ui

# Run only library function tests
npm run test:lib
```

### End-to-End Testing (Cypress)

Run E2E tests with:
```bash
# Open Cypress Test Runner UI
npm run cypress:open
# OR
./run-cypress-tests.bat open

# Run all E2E tests headlessly
npm run cypress:run
# OR
./run-cypress-tests.bat

# Run specific test suite
npm run cypress:skill-search
# OR
./run-cypress-tests.bat skill-search

# Run in specific browser
npm run cypress:chrome
# OR
./run-cypress-tests.bat chrome
```
