# SkillSwap MVP - Test Suite Status Report

## ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING! (As of June 24, 2025)

**Current Status: 28/28 TEST SUITES PASSING (100% Success Rate!)**

After a series of targeted fixes, the entire test suite is now stable and passing. All issues related to Supabase mocking, context providers, and component rendering have been resolved.

### Key Actions Taken:
- **Fixed All Failing Tests:** Addressed failures in `SearchResults`, `LoginForm`, `NotificationService`, and several other components and services by correcting mock implementations and ensuring proper context setup.
- **Standardized Mocking:** Refined the global Supabase mock to handle all necessary query chaining, providing a consistent and reliable testing pattern.
- **Full Suite Validation:** Ran `npm test` to confirm all 28 test suites (215 tests) are passing.
