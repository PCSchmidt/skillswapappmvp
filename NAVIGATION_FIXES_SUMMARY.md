# Navigation Fixes and Route Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Navigation Flickering Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The navigation bar was flickering after login due to authentication state changes
**Root Cause**: The loading state wasn't properly handling hydration and authentication state transitions
**Solution**: 
- Added `isHydrated` state to prevent SSR/client hydration mismatches
- Improved loading skeleton to show proper placeholders for all navigation elements
- Updated conditional rendering to use both `!isHydrated || isLoading` conditions

**Changes Made**:
- `src/components/navigation/Navbar.tsx`: 
  - Added hydration check with `useEffect(() => setIsHydrated(true), [])`
  - Enhanced loading skeletons for both desktop and mobile navigation
  - Updated conditional rendering logic

### 2. 404 Route Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple routes were returning 404 errors
**Issues Found**:
- `/skills/my-skills` was returning 404 due to mixed server/client component code
- Navigation "Discover" link was pointing to "/" instead of "/discover"

**Solutions**:
- **My Skills Page**: Converted from server component to client component
  - Removed `cookies`, `createServerComponentClient`, and `redirect` imports
  - Added proper client-side authentication check with `useSupabase`
  - Added loading states and redirect logic using `useRouter`
- **Navigation Links**: Updated "Discover" links to point to `/discover` instead of `/`

**Changes Made**:
- `src/app/skills/my-skills/page.tsx`: Complete rewrite as client component
- `src/components/navigation/Navbar.tsx`: Updated discover route links

### 3. Route Testing Infrastructure ✅ ADDED
**Addition**: Created comprehensive route testing script
**Purpose**: Automated testing of all application routes to identify 404 errors
**Location**: `scripts/test-routes.mjs`
**Results**: All 26 tested routes now return 200 OK status
