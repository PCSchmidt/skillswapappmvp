2. **Skill Matching**: ✅ Advanced search/filter by category, location, availability with intelligent matching
3. **Barter System**: ✅ Full propose/accept skill trades system (e.g., 1 hour of yoga for 1 hour of coding)
4. **Messaging**: ✅ Complete in-app chat system for trade coordination
5. **Ratings**: ✅ Comprehensive post-trade review system to build trust

### Target Users ✅ Achieved

Successfully targeting hobbyists, freelancers, and learners (18-45 years) in urban areas seeking affordable skill acquisition.

## ✅ Technical Stack - Implemented

- **Frontend**: ✅ Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: ✅ Supabase (authentication, database, storage, real-time)
- **Mobile**: ✅ React Native with Expo (roadmap for future expansion)
- **Deployment**: ✅ Vercel (web) - Production ready
- **Version Control**: ✅ GitHub with automated CI/CD
- **AI Assistance**: ✅ Cline with OpenRouter integration

   - Track which skills a user views frequently
   - Generate personalized recommendations

2. **Barter History and Preferences**
   - Remember user's previous trades
   - Store preferences for trade types
   - Use history to suggest fair exchanges

3. **Contextual Assistance**
