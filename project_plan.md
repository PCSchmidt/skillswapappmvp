# SkillSwap MVP - Project Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the SkillSwap MVP, a skill-sharing and bartering app built with Cline-optimized practices.

## Project Overview

**SkillSwap** is a web and mobile app enabling users to trade skills (e.g., cooking lessons for guitar lessons) in a hyper-local community, fostering barter-based learning without monetary transactions.

### Core Features

1. **User Profiles**: Sign-up/login, skill listing, location, bio
2. **Skill Matching**: Search/filter skills by category, location, availability
3. **Barter System**: Propose/accept skill trades (e.g., 1 hour of yoga for 1 hour of coding)
4. **Basic Messaging**: In-app chat for trade coordination
5. **Ratings**: Post-trade reviews to build trust

### Target Users

Hobbyists, freelancers, and learners (18-45 years) in urban areas seeking affordable skill acquisition.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (authentication, database, storage)
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web), Expo (mobile)
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **AI Assistance**: Cline with OpenRouter (DeepSeek for 80% tasks, Claude 3.7 Sonnet for complex logic)

## Memory Bank Use Cases

The Memory Bank pattern will be crucial for several SkillSwap features:

1. **Personalized Skill Recommendations**
   - Store user interactions with skill categories
   - Track which skills a user views frequently
   - Generate personalized recommendations

2. **Barter History and Preferences**
   - Remember user's previous trades
   - Store preferences for trade types
   - Use history to suggest fair exchanges

3. **Contextual Assistance**
   - Remember user's skill level in different categories
   - Store communication preferences
   - Provide contextual help based on user history

4. **Trust Building**
   - Track successful exchanges
   - Store reputation data
   - Use history to facilitate trust between users
