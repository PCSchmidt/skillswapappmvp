# SkillSwap MVP Code Standards

This directory contains the coding standards and architectural guidelines for the SkillSwap MVP project.

## Purpose

These documents serve as the source of truth for development standards on the SkillSwap project. They ensure consistency across the codebase and provide guidance for both current and future developers.

## Documents

- **[project-architecture.md](./project-architecture.md)**: Overall architectural guidelines and patterns
- **[tech-stack-guidelines.md](./tech-stack-guidelines.md)**: Core technologies and how they should be used
- **[testing-standards.md](./testing-standards.md)**: Testing patterns, organization, and coverage requirements
- **[import-path-standards.md](./import-path-standards.md)**: Standards for import paths and module organization

## Usage

These standards should be referenced during:

1. Code reviews
2. New feature development
3. Refactoring efforts
4. Onboarding new team members

## Enforcement

The standards in these documents are enforced through:

1. ESLint rules (where applicable)
2. Code review processes
3. Pre-commit hooks
4. CI/CD pipeline validations

## Updates

When standards need to be updated:

1. Propose changes via pull request
2. Get approval from at least two senior team members
3. Update relevant tooling configurations to match new standards
4. Communicate changes to the entire development team
