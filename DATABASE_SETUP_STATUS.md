## Next Steps 🚀

### 1. Add Sample Data for Better Demo Experience

**🔗 Direct Link to SQL Editor:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mdmydtumpwilynhdrtqp/sql

**Run this SQL file to add comprehensive demo data:**
```
scripts/skills-sample-data.sql
```

This will add 20 diverse skills across categories like:
- Technology (JavaScript, Python, Digital Marketing, Data Analysis)
- Creative Arts (Photography, Graphic Design, Video Editing)
- Languages (Spanish, French, Mandarin)
- Music (Guitar, Piano)
- Health & Fitness (Yoga, Personal Training)
- Practical Skills (Home Organization, Garden Design, Cooking)

The sample data includes both skills people offer and skills people want to learn, making the demo more realistic.

### 2. User Testing Ready
- Database is fully configured for friends and family testing
- Authentication flow ready for real user registration and login
- All core features can be tested with sample data

### 3. Live Testing
- Ready to deploy and test with real users
- Sample data provides immediate value for demo purposes
3. **Sample Data** - Can now add sample skills using: `node scripts/add-sample-data.mjs`
4. **Feature Development** - All core database tables are ready for MVP features

## Previous Manual Setup Notes

The error `policy "Users can view all user skills" for table "user_skills" already exists` confirmed that the database tables were successfully created during a previous setup attempt. The SQL script in the Supabase SQL Editor had already been executed successfully.

## Next Development Priorities 🎯

**Phase 1: Core Skills Functionality (Current)**

1. ✅ Complete database setup (manual SQL execution needed)
2. 🔄 Implement Skills UI components
3. 🔄 Test User Skills CRUD operations
4. 🔄 Integrate with existing APIs

**Phase 2: User Journey Testing**

1. Test registration → email verification → skill creation flow
2. Test skill search and discovery
3. Test messaging between users
4. Test trade proposal creation and management

**Phase 3: Polish & Production**

1. Complete E2E test coverage
2. Performance optimization
3. Error handling improvements
4. Final UX polish

## Ready Components ✅

- **Backend APIs:** Skills CRUD, User Skills CRUD fully implemented
- **Authentication:** Working with Supabase Auth
- **Basic UI:** Landing page, search, auth forms
- **Environment:** All keys and configuration ready

## Waiting For ⏳

**Database Setup Completion** - Once you run the SQL in Supabase dashboard, we can immediately continue with:

- Skills UI development
- Full user journey testing
- E2E test completion

---

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes to execute the SQL, then ready for immediate development continuation.
