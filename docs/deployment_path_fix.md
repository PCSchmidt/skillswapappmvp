# Path Import Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Summary

The application was failing to build on Vercel due to import path resolution issues. Specifically, the build was failing with the following errors:

```
Failed to compile.
./src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../lib/supabase/client'

./src/app/auth/resend-verification/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../lib/supabase/client'

./src/app/auth/verify/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../lib/supabase/client'

./src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/supabase/client'
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by inconsistent import path styles across the codebase:

1. Some files were using relative imports (e.g., `../../../lib/supabase/client`) 
2. Others were using path aliases (e.g., `@/lib/supabase/client`)
3. In local development, both styles worked, but during Vercel build, the path resolution was stricter

## Changes Made

We standardized all imports to use the path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`:

1. In `SignupForm.tsx`, we corrected an alias-style import:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/client';
   + import { supabase } from '../../lib/supabase/client';
   ```

2. In the auth page components, we updated the relative imports to use aliases:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase/client';
   + import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/client';
   ```

## Path Alias Configuration

The project has path aliases configured in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"],
  "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
  "@lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
  "@types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
  "@ai/*": ["./src/ai/*"]
}
```

## Best Practices Moving Forward

1. **For src/app and src/components directories:** Use path aliases (`@/`) to avoid deep nesting issues
2. **For imports within the same directory:** Use relative imports (`./` or `../`)
3. **For utility functions and shared components:** Always use path aliases
4. **Always test production builds locally** with `npm run build` before deployment

## Additional Notes

- When updating import paths, ensure you update all references to maintain consistency
- Always push path fixes to the relevant branch before attempting deployment
- Document any path-related issues in this file for future reference
