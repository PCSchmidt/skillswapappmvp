# Import Path Resolution Fix for Deployment

## Issue Overview

The SkillSwap MVP deployment was failing on Vercel due to import path resolution errors. The build logs showed errors like:

```
Failed to compile.
./src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve ''lib/supabase/client'' 
./src/app/auth/resend-verification/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve ''lib/supabase/client''
```

These errors occurred because the import paths being used were inconsistent with how Vercel resolves paths in its build environment.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as:

1. **Inconsistent import patterns**: The codebase was using import paths like `@/lib/supabase` which were not properly resolved during the Vercel build process.

2. **Leading slash issue**: The import paths with leading slashes in alias paths (`@/lib/*`) were causing resolution failures on Vercel, despite working properly in the local development environment.

3. **Path alias configuration**: While the TypeScript paths were correctly configured in `tsconfig.json`, the webpack configuration in the Next.js build process needed explicit alignment.

## Solution Implemented

We made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Modified import statements** in all affected auth components:
   - Changed `import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'` to `import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase'`
   - Removed the leading slash from all path aliases
   
2. **Updated the following files**:
   - `src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/auth/verify/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/auth/resend-verification/page.tsx`
   - `src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`

3. **Verified the fix** by running a local build, which completed successfully with no path resolution errors.

## Technical Details

### TypeScript Path Configuration

The project's `tsconfig.json` already had the correct path alias configuration:

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"],
  "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
  "@lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
  "@types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
  "@ai/*": ["./src/ai/*"]
}
```

### Import Pattern Guidelines

For future development, follow these guidelines for imports:

1. **Use alias paths without leading slashes**:
   - ✅ `import { something } from '@lib/module'`
   - ❌ `import { something } from '@/lib/module'`

2. **For components, prefer the dedicated alias**:
   - ✅ `import Component from '@components/Component'`
   - ❌ `import Component from '@/components/Component'`

3. **For closely related files, relative imports are acceptable**:
   - ✅ `import { util } from './utils'`

## Verification Steps

The fix was verified by:

1. Running a local build with `npm run build` which completed successfully
2. Examining the build output to confirm no path resolution errors
3. Confirming that the expected runtime warnings about missing Supabase environment variables were present but did not block the build

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to the repository
2. Configure the required Supabase environment variables in Vercel
3. Trigger a new deployment with `npm run deploy:staging`
4. Monitor the deployment logs to confirm resolution of the path issues

## Lessons Learned

1. Path resolution can differ between local development and cloud build environments
2. Always verify that path aliases are consistently used throughout the codebase
3. When deploying to Vercel, be vigilant about the exact format of import paths
4. Consider adding pre-commit hooks or linting rules to enforce consistent import patterns
