# OAuth Implementation Roadmap for SkillSwap

## Current Status: Email/Password Authentication âœ…

We've implemented a robust email and password authentication system to get you started with SkillSwap immediately.

## Planned OAuth Providers (Coming Soon)

### Phase 1: Google OAuth
- **Timeline**: Next 2-4 weeks  
- **Benefit**: Quick sign-up with Google accounts
- **Implementation**: Firebase Auth (Free tier: 50,000 monthly users)

### Phase 2: GitHub OAuth  
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
- **Benefit**: Perfect for developers sharing programming skills
- **Implementation**: Native GitHub OAuth or Supabase Auth

### Phase 3: LinkedIn OAuth
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
- **Benefit**: Professional network integration for skill validation
- **Implementation**: LinkedIn Developer Program (free)

## Why We're Taking This Approach

1. **Zero Budget MVP**: We're building smart and lean
2. **User Feedback**: We want to understand which OAuth providers you actually want
3. **Security First**: We're taking time to implement OAuth securely
4. **Core Features**: Focusing on skill matching and trading first

## Current Workarounds

- **Quick Signup**: Email signup takes 30 seconds
- **Password Security**: Secure password reset available
- **Profile Import**: Manual profile setup (we'll add import features later)
