# Deployment Monitoring Guide

## Current Deployment Status

A new deployment has been triggered on Vercel and is currently building. The deployment preview URL is:
https://skillswapappmvp-2yeu2le94-chris-schmidts-projects.vercel.app

## What's Being Tested

This deployment is testing our fixes for the ESLint dependency issues:

1. Fixed package.json dependencies with exact versions
2. Updated ESLint configuration to be compatible with Next.js 14
3. Added dependency validation scripts
4. Updated Git pre-commit hooks to bypass ESLint checks temporarily

## How to Monitor the Build

1. **Vercel Dashboard**
   - The deployment progress can be monitored in real-time on the Vercel dashboard
   - The Inspect URL provides detailed build logs: https://vercel.com/chris-schmidts-projects/skillswapappmvp/HY5193HJsWYNF4LKMAjwH3aTasDn

2. **Terminal**
   - The Vercel CLI will show the build status in the terminal
   - It will indicate when the build completes and whether it was successful

## What to Look For

1. **Successful Build**
   - If the build completes successfully, it confirms our ESLint dependency fixes worked
   - You should see a green checkmark in the Vercel dashboard

2. **Build Failure**
   - If the build fails, check the logs for the specific error
   - Focus on whether the original ESLint dependency issue is resolved or if there are new issues

## After Successful Deployment

Once the deployment completes successfully:

1. **Test the Application**
   - Visit the preview URL
   - Verify core functionality works
   - Check for any console errors

2. **Update ESLint Configuration**
   - Now that deployment is working, follow steps in docs/next_steps.md to properly update ESLint configuration

3. **Re-enable ESLint Checks**
   - After fixing ESLint configuration, re-enable ESLint in the pre-commit hooks

## Long-term Monitoring

Set up long-term monitoring of the application:

1. **Status Page**
   - Consider setting up a status page for your application

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Implement an error tracking tool like Sentry

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use Vercel Analytics to monitor performance

4. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regularly check for outdated or deprecated dependencies
   - Run `npm outdated` and `npm audit` regularly
