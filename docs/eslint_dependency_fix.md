# ESLint Dependency and Configuration Fix

## Issue
The project was encountering ESLint issues when running commits, with specific errors regarding deprecated ESLint options:

```
Invalid Options:
- Unknown options: useEslintrc, extensions, resolvePluginsRelativeTo, rulePaths, ignorePath, reportUnusedDisableDirectives   
- 'extensions' has been removed.
- 'resolvePluginsRelativeTo' has been removed.
- 'ignorePath' has been removed.
- 'rulePaths' has been removed. Please define your rules using plugins.
- 'reportUnusedDisableDirectives' has been removed. Please use the 'overrideConfig.linterOptions.reportUnusedDisableDirectives' option instead.
```

This was preventing smooth commits and CI/CD pipeline operation.

## Solution

1. Updated `.eslintrc.cjs` configuration to use modern ESLint syntax and options.
2. Installed missing dependencies: `eslint-plugin-import` and `eslint-import-resolver-typescript`.
3. Fixed configuration to remove all deprecated CLI options.
4. Updated linter settings to use proper options structure for modern ESLint version (v8.57.0).

### Key Changes

- Removed deprecated options and replaced them with their modern equivalents.
- Added proper import resolution for TypeScript files to prevent path-related linting errors.
- Updated settings for reporting unused disable directives.
- Enhanced import order rules for better code organization.
- Fixed settings for proper TypeScript and Node.js import resolution.

### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "eslint-plugin-import": "^latest",
  "eslint-import-resolver-typescript": "^latest"
}
```

## Testing and Verification

The fixed configuration was tested by running `npx eslint --version` to confirm the correct version (v8.57.0) and by attempting git commits to verify no ESLint-related errors occurred.

## Future Maintenance

ESLint configuration should be periodically reviewed when upgrading dependencies, particularly when ESLint itself is updated. If new linting errors appear during commits, the `.eslintrc.cjs` file should be the first place to check for potential configuration issues.
