# SkillSwap MVP Phase 10: Deployment & Launch Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for completing Phase 10 of the SkillSwap MVP project, focusing on deployment and launch.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Phase 9 (Testing & Optimization) is complete
- üîÑ Phase 10 (Deployment & Launch) is in progress
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous deployment attempts have failed due to environment variable configuration issues

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Environment Variables Configuration

The primary blocker for deployment is the environment variables configuration. The current `.env.staging` file contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with actual credentials.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update the Supabase configuration in `.env.staging` with actual credentials:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mdmydtumpwilynhdrtqp.supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[Get from Supabase Dashboard]
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[Get from Supabase Dashboard]
  SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=[Get from Supabase Dashboard]
  ```
- [ ] Update the authentication variables:
  ```
  AUTH_SECRET=[Generate secure random string]
  JWT_SECRET=[Generate secure random string]
  ```
- [ ] Update the email configuration:
  ```
  RESEND_API_KEY=[Get from Resend Dashboard]
  ```
- [ ] Update the Sentry DSN (for error monitoring):
  ```
  SENTRY_DSN=[Get from Sentry Dashboard]
  ```

### 2. Trigger a New Deployment

After fixing the environment variables, trigger a new deployment to the staging environment.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Run pre-deployment validation tests
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- [ ] Execute the deployment script:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:staging
  # or
  cd skillswap_mvp && npx vercel --prod
  ```
- [ ] Monitor the deployment logs for successful connection to Supabase

### 3. Verify Successful Deployment

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Follow the verification checklist in `docs/deployment_verification_steps.md`
- [ ] Test all critical user flows:
  - [ ] Authentication (signup, login, password reset)
  - [ ] Profile management
  - [ ] Skill search and filtering
  - [ ] Matching functionality
  - [ ] Messaging system
  - [ ] Notifications and email delivery
- [ ] Verify proper loading of all assets and components
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors or warnings
- [ ] Test the application on multiple devices and browsers

## Deployment Optimization Tasks

Once the initial deployment is successful, complete these optimization tasks:

### 1. Setup Monitoring Infrastructure

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Complete Sentry integration for error tracking
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Implement logging for key user actions

### 2. Finalize Database Configuration

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Apply the latest database migration scripts
- [ ] Set up database backup schedule
- [ ] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) for production
- [ ] Verify database connection pool settings for optimal performance

### 3. Implement CI/CD Pipeline

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Finalize GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- [ ] Implement pre-deployment testing in CI pipeline
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Set up staging and production environment deployment workflow

### 4. Optimize Performance for Production

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Finalize code splitting implementation
- [ ] Complete image optimization configuration
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Configure CDN settings for static assets
- [ ] Run final performance audits using Lighthouse

## Launch Preparation

### 1. Create Documentation

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Finalize user guide documentation
- [ ] Prepare administrator documentation
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides

### 2. Prepare Launch Announcements

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Finalize launch announcement content
- [ ] Prepare social media posts
- [ ] Create email templates for initial user invitations
- [ ] Schedule announcements

### 3. Beta Testing Transition

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Implement the beta testing plan outlined in `docs/beta_testing_strategy.md`
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanisms
- [ ] Set up analytics to track beta tester behavior
- [ ] Prepare for iterative improvements based on feedback

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Environment Configuration and Initial Deployment** - 1-2 days
2. **Deployment Verification and Optimization** - 2-3 days
3. **Monitoring and CI/CD Setup** - 2 days
4. **Launch Preparation and Documentation** - 2 days
5. **Beta Testing Phase** - 1-2 weeks
6. **Official Launch** - Target date TBD based on beta testing results

## Success Criteria

Phase 10 will be considered complete when:

1. The application is successfully deployed to the staging environment
2. All critical features function as expected
3. Monitoring infrastructure is in place
4. CI/CD pipeline is operational
5. Beta testing plan is implemented and ready for execution
6. Launch documentation is complete

## Contingency Plans

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Document the steps for rolling back to the previous stable version
   - Identify trigger conditions for rollback

2. **Critical Issue Resolution Process**
   - Establish priority order for addressing deployment issues
   - Define the escalation process for critical bugs

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Prepare templates for communicating issues to stakeholders
   - Establish status update frequency during critical incidents
