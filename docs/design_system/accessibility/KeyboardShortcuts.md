# Keyboard Shortcuts Guidelines

This document outlines guidelines for implementing keyboard shortcuts across the SkillSwap application to enhance usability and accessibility for users who prefer or require keyboard navigation.

## Principles

-   **Consistency**: Keyboard shortcuts should be consistent across the application for similar actions.
-   **Discoverability**: Users should be able to discover available shortcuts, ideally through UI hints or a dedicated help section.
-   **Avoid Conflicts**: Shortcuts should not conflict with browser or operating system shortcuts.
-   **User Control**: Provide options for users to customize or disable shortcuts if necessary.

## Guidelines

### 1. Standard Modifiers

Use standard modifier keys to avoid conflicts and provide a familiar experience.

*   **`Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd` (macOS)**: For application-level actions (e.g., save, print, copy, paste).
*   **`Alt` (Windows/Linux) / `Option` (macOS)**: For alternative actions or menu access.
*   **`Shift`**: For inverse actions or extending selections.

### 2. Common Shortcuts

Implement common, widely recognized keyboard shortcuts where applicable.

*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + S`**: Save
*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + Z`**: Undo
*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + Y`**: Redo
*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + C`**: Copy
*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + X`**: Cut
*   **`Ctrl/Cmd + V`**: Paste
*   **`Esc`**: Close modals, dismiss dropdowns, clear search.
*   **`Tab` / `Shift + Tab`**: Navigate interactive elements (handled by browser default, but ensure logical order).
*   **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within lists, menus, or carousels.

### 3. Contextual Shortcuts

Shortcuts can be specific to a particular component or view, but ensure they are clearly documented or indicated.

*   **Example**: In a text editor, `Ctrl/Cmd + B` for bold, `Ctrl/Cmd + I` for italic.

### 4. Avoid Single-Key Shortcuts

Avoid using single letter or number keys as shortcuts unless a modifier key is also pressed, as this can interfere with normal text input.

*   **Exception**: If a component is designed specifically for single-key input (e.g., a game, a media player with play/pause on spacebar), ensure it doesn't interfere with other inputs.

### 5. Documentation and Hints

*   **Tooltips**: For frequently used actions, include the shortcut in the tooltip (e.g., "Save (Ctrl+S)").
*   **Help Section**: Provide a dedicated section in the application's help or settings that lists all available keyboard shortcuts.
*   **Onboarding**: Introduce key shortcuts during user onboarding for complex features.

## Implementation Notes

-   Use JavaScript event listeners (e.g., `keydown`, `keyup`) to capture keyboard events.
-   Be mindful of event propagation and prevent default browser actions when implementing custom shortcuts.
-   Test shortcuts thoroughly across different browsers and operating systems.

## Future Considerations

-   Implement a user-configurable shortcut mapping system.
-   Develop a visual overlay that displays available shortcuts on demand.
-   Integrate automated testing for keyboard shortcut functionality.
