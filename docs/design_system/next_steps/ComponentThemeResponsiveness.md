# Ensuring Component Responsiveness to Theme Changes

This document outlines the process for verifying and ensuring that all components in the SkillSwap application respond correctly and consistently to theme changes (e.g., light to dark mode). This is crucial for a seamless and accessible user experience.

## Objectives

-   Confirm that all visual aspects of components (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, icons) adapt correctly when the theme is switched.
-   Identify and fix any components that do not properly inherit or apply theme-specific styles.
-   Ensure interactive states (hover, focus, active) remain visually distinct and accessible in both themes.
-   Verify that theme changes do not introduce layout shifts or performance issues.

## Process

### 1. Preparation

*   **Theme Switching Mechanism**: Ensure the theme switching mechanism (as outlined in `docs/design_system/theme/ThemeSwitchingMechanism.md`) is fully implemented and functional in both the application and Storybook.
*   **Dark Theme Color Palette**: Have the `docs/design_system/theme/DarkThemeColors.md` readily available for reference.
*   **Component List**: Access a comprehensive list of all implemented components.

### 2. Component-by-Component Theme Review

Go through each component in Storybook (using the theme switcher) and in the live application, applying the following checks:

#### Visual Adaptation

*   **Backgrounds**:
    *   Does the component's background color correctly switch between light and dark theme variants?
    *   For nested components (e.g., a card inside a section), do their backgrounds maintain appropriate contrast and hierarchy?
*   **Text Colors**:
    *   Do all text elements (headings, paragraphs, labels, placeholders) switch to the correct theme-specific colors?
    *   Is the contrast ratio between text and its background sufficient in both themes (WCAG 2.1 AA)?
*   **Borders & Dividers**:
    *   Do borders and dividers change to the appropriate neutral shades for the active theme?
    *   Are they still visually distinct but not overly prominent?
*   **Icons & SVGs**:
    *   Do icons change color to match the theme's text/icon palette?
    *   If SVGs have inline `fill` or `stroke` attributes, are they overridden by CSS or dynamically adjusted?
*   **Shadows**:
    *   Do box shadows and drop shadows adapt to be subtle and appropriate for the dark background? (e.g., less opaque or lighter shadows in dark mode).
*   **Gradients**:
    *   If components use gradients, do they transition smoothly or have a dark-mode specific variant?

#### Interactive States

*   **Hover/Focus/Active**:
    *   Do these states provide clear visual feedback in both light and dark themes?
    *   Is the contrast of the interactive state sufficient against the component's background and its default state?
    *   Are focus rings clearly visible in dark mode?

#### Edge Cases and Dynamic Content

*   **User-Generated Content**: If components display user-generated content, ensure it remains readable and styled appropriately in both themes.
*   **Error/Success States**: Verify that alert and feedback components (e.g., `Alert` component) display correctly with their specific colors in dark mode.
*   **Disabled States**: Check that disabled elements are still perceivable as disabled in dark mode.

### 3. Page-Level Theme Review

After component-level review, test entire pages by switching themes.

*   **Overall Harmony**: Does the entire page feel cohesive and visually balanced in both themes?
*   **Layout Stability**: Do theme changes cause any unexpected layout shifts or reflows?
*   **Performance**: Is the theme switch instantaneous and smooth, without any noticeable flicker or delay?

### 4. Documentation and Testing Updates

*   **Component Documentation**: Add specific notes to component JSDoc or markdown files regarding their dark mode implementation details or any special considerations.
*   **Storybook**: Ensure all relevant stories are tested with the theme switcher.
*   **Automated Testing**:
    *   If visual regression testing is implemented, add test cases for both light and dark themes.
    *   If accessibility testing is automated, ensure it runs for both themes.

## Tools for Review

*   **Storybook**: For isolated component theme testing.
*   **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting computed styles, simulating `prefers-color-scheme`, and debugging.
*   **Accessibility Tools**: WebAIM Contrast Checker, Lighthouse, Axe DevTools.
*   **Visual Regression Testing Tools**: (If implemented) for automated visual checks across themes.

## Future Considerations

-   Develop a "theme audit" tool that automatically flags potential contrast or styling issues in dark mode.
-   Explore a more granular theming system if specific sub-components require unique theme overrides.
