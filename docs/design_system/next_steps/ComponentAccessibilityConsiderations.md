# Including Accessibility Considerations in Component Documentation

This document outlines the process for integrating detailed accessibility considerations into the documentation of each component within the SkillSwap design system. This ensures that developers are equipped with the knowledge to implement components in an accessible manner, fostering an inclusive user experience.

## Objectives

-   Provide specific, actionable accessibility guidance for each component.
-   Reference relevant WCAG principles and ARIA guidelines.
-   Highlight potential accessibility pitfalls and how to avoid them.
-   Ensure accessibility documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## Process

### 1. Preparation

*   **Component List**: Access a comprehensive list of all implemented components.
*   **Accessibility Guidelines**: Have all accessibility documentation (WCAG, ARIA, Tab Order, Keyboard Shortcuts, Screen Reader Testing, Color Contrast) readily available.
*   **Storybook Access**: Ensure Storybook is running for live component inspection.

### 2. Component-by-Component Accessibility Documentation

Go through each component and add/update its accessibility considerations. This typically involves updating JSDoc comments within the component file and/or adding dedicated sections within MDX documentation files (`ComponentName.stories.mdx`).

#### For Each Component, Document:

*   **General Accessibility Statement**: A brief statement emphasizing the component's commitment to accessibility.
*   **Keyboard Interaction**:
    *   Describe expected keyboard behavior (e.g., `Tab` for focus, `Enter`/`Space` for activation, `Esc` for dismissal, arrow keys for navigation within groups).
    *   Reference `TabOrderOptimization.md` and `KeyboardShortcuts.md`.
    *   Example: "Focusable via `Tab`. Activates on `Enter` or `Space`."
*   **Screen Reader Announceables (ARIA)**:
    *   Specify which ARIA roles, states, and properties are used and why (e.g., `role="button"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`).
    *   Explain what a screen reader user will hear.
    *   Reference `ARIAAttributes.md`.
    *   Example: "Icon-only buttons use `aria-label` to provide an accessible name."
*   **Color Contrast**:
    *   Confirm that text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios in all states (default, hover, focus, active).
    *   Reference `ColorContrastTextOnColoredBackgrounds.md` and `ColorContrastInteractiveStates.md`.
    *   Example: "Ensures 4.5:1 contrast for text and 3:1 for non-text interactive elements."
*   **Focus Management**:
    *   If the component manages focus (e.g., modals, dropdowns), describe how focus is shifted and trapped.
    *   Reference `TabOrderOptimization.md`.
    *   Example: "Focus is automatically trapped within the modal when opened."
*   **Semantic HTML**:
    *   Note if the component uses semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<input>`, `<nav>`) and why this is beneficial for accessibility.
*   **Customization Notes**:
    *   If the component allows customization that could impact accessibility (e.g., custom content in a button), provide warnings or best practices.
    *   Example: "When providing custom children to `Button`, ensure interactive elements within are properly labeled."

### 3. Integration with Storybook

*   **MDX Documentation**: For components with complex accessibility needs, create a dedicated "Accessibility" section within their MDX documentation.
*   **`parameters.docs.description.story`**: Include brief accessibility notes here for quick reference.
*   **`argTypes` Descriptions**: Ensure `description` for props related to accessibility (e.g., `aria-label` props) is clear.

### 4. Review and Validation

*   **Accessibility Experts**: Have accessibility specialists or experienced developers review the documentation.
*   **Screen Reader Testing**: Use screen readers to verify that the documented accessibility features work as described.
*   **Automated Audits**: Run automated accessibility audits (Lighthouse, Axe DevTools) against components to catch any missed issues.

## Tools

*   **Storybook**: For component isolation and documentation.
*   **JSDoc/MDX**: For writing documentation.
*   **Accessibility Testing Tools**: Screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver), browser accessibility inspectors, automated linters (Axe-core).

## Future Considerations

-   Develop a Storybook addon that provides real-time accessibility feedback directly in the component preview.
-   Create a dedicated "Accessibility Checklist" for each component type.
-   Automate accessibility documentation generation from code comments and ARIA attributes.
