# Responsive Behavior Review

This document outlines the process for reviewing and ensuring responsive behavior across all components in the SkillSwap application. Responsive design is critical for providing an optimal user experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

## Objectives

-   Verify that all components adapt gracefully to different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
-   Ensure text, images, and interactive elements scale appropriately.
-   Identify and fix any layout shifts, overflows, or broken designs at various screen sizes.
-   Confirm consistent application of responsive spacing, typography, and grid patterns.

## Review Process

### 1. Preparation

*   **Responsive Design Tools**: Utilize browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools' Device Mode) or dedicated responsive testing tools.
*   **Storybook Access**: Ensure Storybook is running and components can be viewed in isolation.
*   **Device Emulators/Real Devices**: Test on a variety of emulated devices and, ideally, real physical devices.
*   **Checklist**: Use this document as a checklist for each component.

### 2. Component-by-Component Review

Go through each component in Storybook and the live application, applying the following checks at various breakpoints:

#### General Responsiveness

*   **Fluid Layouts**: Do components fluidly adjust their width and height based on available space?
*   **Breakpoints**: Do components correctly apply styles at `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `2xl` breakpoints?
*   **Text Scaling**: Does text remain readable and appropriately sized across breakpoints? Avoid excessively small text on mobile or excessively large text on desktop.
*   **Image Scaling**: Do images scale correctly without distortion or overflow?
*   **Interactive Elements**: Are buttons, inputs, and other interactive elements still easily tappable/clickable on touch devices?

#### Specific Layout Patterns

*   **Container**: Does content within containers correctly constrain its width and center itself at different screen sizes?
*   **Grid**:
    *   Does the number of columns change as defined by the `columns` prop at each breakpoint?
    *   Does the `gap` between grid items adjust responsively?
    *   Do `Column` components correctly span and start at their defined responsive values?
*   **Stack**: Does the spacing between stacked items adjust responsively? Does the direction change if defined (e.g., `flex-col` on mobile, `flex-row` on desktop)?
*   **Section**: Does the `spacingY` (vertical padding) adjust correctly at different breakpoints? Does the `container` prop correctly apply max-width and centering?

#### Content Handling

*   **Overflow**: Are there any horizontal scrolls or content overflows at any breakpoint?
*   **Word Wrapping**: Does long text wrap gracefully without breaking the layout?
*   **Truncation**: If text is truncated, is it done gracefully (e.g., `line-clamp`) and is the full content accessible (e.g., via tooltip)?

#### Navigation and Menus

*   **Mobile Navigation**: Does the main navigation collapse into a hamburger menu or similar pattern on mobile? Is it accessible and easy to use?
*   **Desktop Navigation**: Does the navigation utilize available space effectively on larger screens?

### 3. Performance Considerations

*   **Image Optimization**: Are responsive images used (e.g., `srcset`, `sizes`) to load appropriate image sizes for different viewports?
*   **Lazy Loading**: Is off-screen content lazy-loaded to improve initial page load performance?
*   **CSS/JS Loading**: Are critical CSS and JavaScript loaded efficiently for the initial viewport?

## Tools for Review

*   **Browser Developer Tools (Device Mode)**: Simulate various screen sizes and devices.
*   **Storybook Viewports Addon**: Configure custom viewports within Storybook for quick testing.
*   **Real Devices**: Essential for testing touch interactions, performance, and actual rendering.
*   **Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights**: For performance and general accessibility audits.

## Future Considerations

-   Automate visual regression testing across multiple breakpoints.
-   Integrate responsive design linting into the development workflow.
-   Develop a "responsive playground" within Storybook to easily manipulate breakpoints and preview components.
