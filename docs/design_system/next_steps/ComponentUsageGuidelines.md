# Adding Usage Guidelines for All Components

This document outlines the process for adding comprehensive usage guidelines to all components within the SkillSwap design system. Clear guidelines are essential for developers to understand how to correctly implement and utilize components, ensuring consistency and maintainability across the application.

## Objectives

-   Provide clear, concise, and actionable instructions for component usage.
-   Document all available props, their types, and their effects.
-   Illustrate common use cases and best practices with code examples.
-   Highlight any important considerations or limitations for each component.
-   Ensure documentation is easily accessible and up-to-date.

## Process

### 1. Preparation

*   **Component List**: Access a comprehensive list of all implemented components (both core and feature).
*   **Storybook Access**: Ensure Storybook is running and all components are accessible.
*   **Design Specifications**: Have design mockups and specifications readily available for reference.

### 2. Component-by-Component Documentation

Go through each component and add/update its usage guidelines. This typically involves updating JSDoc comments within the component file and/or adding dedicated markdown files (e.g., `ComponentName.md` or within `ComponentName.stories.tsx` using MDX).

#### For Each Component, Document:

*   **Purpose/Overview**: A brief description of what the component does and when to use it.
*   **Props**:
    *   List all props, their types, default values, and a clear description of their function.
    *   Use JSDoc comments for inline documentation.
    *   Example:
        ```typescript
        /**
         * The text content of the button.
         */
        children: React.ReactNode;
        /**
         * The visual style variant of the button.
         * @default "primary"
         */
        variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'danger';
        ```
*   **Variants**:
    *   Clearly describe each variant (e.g., primary, secondary, disabled states for buttons).
    *   Provide visual examples (from Storybook) and corresponding code snippets.
*   **Usage Examples**:
    *   Provide simple, copy-pastable code examples for common use cases.
    *   Show how to combine the component with other elements or props.
    *   Example:
        ```jsx
        <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
          Submit Form
        </Button>
        ```
*   **Best Practices**:
    *   Guidelines on when to use the component versus another.
    *   Performance considerations.
    *   Accessibility notes (e.g., "Always provide an `aria-label` for icon-only buttons").
*   **Accessibility Considerations**:
    *   Specific notes on keyboard navigation, screen reader behavior, and contrast.
    *   Refer to `docs/design_system/accessibility` documents.
*   **Limitations/Known Issues**:
    *   Any current limitations or known bugs.
    *   Future enhancements planned.

### 3. Integration with Storybook

*   **MDX Files**: For richer documentation, consider creating MDX files (`ComponentName.stories.mdx`) that combine component stories with markdown documentation.
*   **`parameters.docs.description.story`**: Use this in `*.stories.tsx` files for short, story-specific documentation.
*   **`argTypes` Descriptions**: Ensure `description` is provided for all `argTypes` to generate automatic prop tables in Storybook.

### 4. Review and Validation

*   **Peer Review**: Have other developers review the documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
*   **Designer Review**: Ensure the documentation accurately reflects the design intent.
*   **User Testing**: If possible, observe developers using the documentation to identify areas for improvement.

## Tools

*   **Storybook**: Primary platform for showcasing and documenting components.
*   **JSDoc**: For inline code documentation.
*   **Markdown/MDX**: For rich text documentation.
*   **TypeScript**: For defining clear prop interfaces.

## Future Considerations

-   Automate documentation generation from code comments.
-   Implement a "live code editor" within Storybook documentation for interactive examples.
-   Create a dedicated "Usage Guidelines" section in the main design system documentation.
