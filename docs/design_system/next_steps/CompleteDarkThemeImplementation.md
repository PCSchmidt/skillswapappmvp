# Completing Dark Theme Implementation

This document outlines the final steps and considerations for completing the dark theme implementation across the SkillSwap application. A fully functional and polished dark theme enhances user experience and provides a modern aesthetic.

## Objectives

-   Ensure all components and pages render correctly and consistently in dark mode.
-   Verify adherence to the defined dark theme color palette and styling guidelines.
-   Confirm accessibility standards (contrast, focus states) are met in dark mode.
-   Implement a robust theme switching mechanism.
-   Address any remaining visual bugs or inconsistencies in dark mode.

## Process

### 1. Comprehensive Component Review (Dark Mode)

Go through every component in Storybook and the live application, specifically testing its appearance and behavior in dark mode.

*   **Backgrounds**: Verify that all backgrounds (page, card, modal, input) correctly switch to their dark theme counterparts.
*   **Text Colors**: Ensure all text (headings, body, helper, placeholder) has appropriate contrast and color in dark mode.
*   **Borders & Dividers**: Check that borders and dividers are subtle and consistent with dark theme neutrals.
*   **Icons & SVGs**: Confirm icons are visible and have appropriate color in dark mode. If using SVG, ensure their fills/strokes adapt.
*   **Interactive Elements**:
    *   **Buttons**: Verify all button variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger) render correctly in dark mode, including their hover, focus, and active states.
    *   **Inputs/Textareas/Selects**: Check background, text, border, and placeholder colors. Ensure focus rings are visible.
    *   **Links**: Confirm link colors are distinct and accessible.
*   **Images & Media**: Review images and other media. If any images have light backgrounds that clash with dark mode, consider providing dark mode specific versions or applying subtle overlays.
*   **Shadows**: Ensure box shadows and drop shadows are subtle and appropriate for dark backgrounds.

### 2. Page-Level Dark Theme Review

After component-level review, test entire pages in dark mode.

*   **Layouts**: Verify that overall page layouts remain stable and visually balanced.
*   **Edge Cases**: Check pages with complex data, tables, or many interactive elements.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: If using any third-party libraries or embedded content, ensure they also adapt to dark mode or are styled to blend in.

### 3. Theme Switching Mechanism Implementation

Implement the theme switching mechanism as outlined in `docs/design_system/theme/ThemeSwitchingMechanism.md`.

*   **Initial Load**: Ensure the correct theme (based on `localStorage` or `prefers-color-scheme`) is applied without a "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC).
*   **User Interface**: Integrate a user-friendly toggle or selector for theme switching (e.g., in user settings or a global header).
*   **Persistence**: Confirm the user's theme preference is saved and loaded correctly across sessions.

### 4. Accessibility Validation (Dark Theme Specific)

*   **Color Contrast**: Re-run color contrast checks for all text and interactive elements in dark mode to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Pay special attention to subtle color differences.
*   **Focus States**: Verify that keyboard focus indicators are clearly visible against dark backgrounds.
*   **Screen Reader**: Conduct a final round of screen reader testing in dark mode to ensure all elements are announced correctly.

### 5. Documentation and Testing Updates

*   **Component Documentation**: Update JSDoc comments and any separate markdown files for components to include specific dark mode styling notes or considerations.
*   **Storybook**: Ensure all Storybook stories can be viewed in both light and dark themes (if a global theme switcher is implemented in Storybook).
*   **Automated Testing**:
    *   If visual regression testing is set up, add test cases for dark mode.
    *   If accessibility testing is automated, ensure it runs against dark mode as well.

## Tools for Completion

*   **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting styles, debugging, and simulating `prefers-color-scheme`.
*   **Storybook**: For isolated component testing.
*   **Accessibility Tools**: WebAIM Contrast Checker, Lighthouse, Axe DevTools, screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).
*   **Visual Regression Testing Tools**: (If implemented) for automated visual checks.

## Future Considerations

-   Explore adding more theme options (e.g., high contrast, sepia).
-   Provide a mechanism for users to override specific dark mode styles if needed.
