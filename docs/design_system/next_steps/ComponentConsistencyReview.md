# Component Consistency Review

This document outlines the process for reviewing all existing components in the SkillSwap application to ensure consistency with the established design system guidelines. This review is crucial for maintaining a cohesive user experience and a maintainable codebase.

## Objectives

-   Verify adherence to design token definitions (colors, typography, spacing, borders, shadows).
-   Ensure consistent application of layout patterns (Container, Grid, Column, Stack, Section).
-   Confirm consistent interaction patterns (hover, focus, active states).
-   Validate accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation, contrast).
-   Identify and address any visual discrepancies or deviations from the design system.

## Review Process

### 1. Preparation

*   **Gather Documentation**: Have all design system documentation (color palettes, typography scales, spacing, accessibility guidelines, etc.) readily available.
*   **Storybook Access**: Ensure Storybook is running and all components are accessible.
*   **Checklist**: Use this document as a checklist for each component.

### 2. Component-by-Component Review

Go through each component in Storybook and the live application, applying the following checks:

#### Visual Consistency

*   **Colors**:
    *   Are primary, secondary, neutral, and feedback colors used correctly?
    *   Do interactive elements use the correct hover/focus/active colors?
    *   Is text contrast sufficient on all backgrounds (light and dark themes)?
    *   Are gradients applied as per definitions?
*   **Typography**:
    *   Are font families, sizes, weights, and line heights consistent with the typography scale?
    *   Are text transformations (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize) applied appropriately?
*   **Spacing**:
    *   Is internal padding and external margin consistent with the responsive spacing scale?
    *   Are gaps between elements (in flex/grid) consistent?
*   **Borders/Radius**:
    *   Are border widths and radius values consistent?
    *   Are border styles (solid, dashed) used appropriately?
*   **Shadows**:
    *   Are box shadows and drop shadows applied consistently and subtly?
    *   Do interactive elements use appropriate shadow changes on hover/focus?

#### Interaction Consistency

*   **Hover States**: Do all interactive elements have clear and consistent hover states?
*   **Focus States**: Are focus indicators visible, distinct, and consistent across all interactive elements?
*   **Active/Pressed States**: Do buttons and other interactive elements have clear active/pressed states?
*   **Disabled States**: Are disabled elements clearly distinguishable but still perceivable?

#### Accessibility

*   **Keyboard Navigation**:
    *   Can all interactive elements be reached and operated using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space)?
    *   Is the tab order logical and intuitive?
    *   Are there any keyboard traps?
*   **ARIA Attributes**:
    *   Are appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties used for custom interactive components?
    *   Are `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` used for icon-only buttons and complex widgets?
    *   Are live regions (`aria-live`) used for dynamic content updates?
*   **Screen Reader Support**:
    *   Test with a screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure content is announced correctly and navigation is logical.
    *   Verify `alt` text for images and accessible names for controls.

#### Code Consistency

*   **Prop Naming**: Are props named consistently across similar components?
*   **File Structure**: Are components organized logically within the `src/components` directory?
*   **Import Paths**: Are absolute imports (`@/`) used consistently?
*   **Utility Usage**: Is `cn` used for combining class names?

### 3. Documentation Update

*   For any identified inconsistencies or deviations, create a new issue or update existing documentation to reflect the required changes.
*   Prioritize critical accessibility or visual bugs.

## Tools for Review

*   **Storybook**: For isolated component review.
*   **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspect elements, check computed styles, and use accessibility tabs.
*   **Accessibility Linters/Auditors**: Lighthouse, Axe DevTools, ESLint a11y plugins.
*   **Screen Readers**: NVDA, VoiceOver.

## Future Considerations

-   Automate visual regression testing to catch visual inconsistencies.
-   Implement a "design linter" that checks for adherence to design tokens in code.
-   Conduct regular, scheduled consistency reviews.
