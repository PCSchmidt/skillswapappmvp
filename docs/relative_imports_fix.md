# Relative Imports Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Summary

The SkillSwap MVP project was failing to deploy on Vercel due to path alias resolution issues. The build logs showed errors like:

```
Failed to compile.
./src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@lib/supabase'
```

## Investigation

After analyzing the build errors, we determined that Vercel's build environment was not correctly resolving the path aliases defined in our project, even though they worked in local development.

This type of issue is common when there's a discrepancy between how path aliases are processed in the local development environment versus the cloud build environment.

## Solution Implemented

We took a more reliable approach by replacing path aliases with relative imports for the affected files:

1. **src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx**:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';
   + import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';
   ```

2. **src/app/auth/verify/page.tsx**:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';
   + import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';
   ```

3. **src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx**:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';
   + import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';
   ```

4. **src/app/auth/resend-verification/page.tsx**:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';
   + import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';
   ```

5. **src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx**:
   ```diff
   - import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';
   + import { supabase } from '../../lib/supabase';
   ```

## Rationale

While path aliases provide cleaner imports and avoid deep relative path traversal, using explicit relative paths is more reliable across different build environments. 

This approach ensures that:

1. The build process doesn't depend on path alias resolution configuration
2. Paths are resolved consistently regardless of the build environment
3. We avoid the complexities of trying to synchronize webpack and TypeScript path configurations

## Future Considerations

For future development, we should consider:

1. **Standardizing Import Patterns**: Create a clear guide for the team on when to use aliases vs. relative imports
   
2. **CI Verification**: Add a pre-deployment check that verifies builds will succeed in the Vercel environment

3. **Environment Parity**: Ensure development and production environments have matching configuration for path resolution

4. **Alternative Approaches**: If aliases are strongly preferred, investigate more robust configuration that works consistently across environments:
   - Using Next.js built-in path aliasing without webpack customization
   - Adding explicit Vercel-specific configuration
   - Creating a centralized import module that abstracts away path complexities

This fix prioritizes reliability and deployment stability over code aesthetics, which is the appropriate tradeoff for a production application.
