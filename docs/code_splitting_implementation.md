# Code Splitting Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the code splitting strategy for the SkillSwap MVP application to improve performance and reduce initial load times.

## Goals

- Reduce initial JavaScript bundle size
- Improve Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics
- Optimize loading of non-critical components
- Maintain functionality for all users regardless of device or network conditions

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Route-Based Code Splitting

Next.js provides automatic code splitting at the page level. Each page becomes its own bundle that is loaded only when the user navigates to that page. We'll optimize this further by:

- Ensuring all pages use dynamic imports for large components
- Configuring custom loading states for each route
- Using proper Next.js patterns to avoid unnecessary client-side JS loading

### 2. Component-Level Code Splitting

For large components that aren't immediately visible or necessary on initial load:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Before: Direct import
// import HeavyComponent from '@components/HeavyComponent';

// After: Dynamic import with loading state
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('@components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <LoadingPlaceholder />,
  ssr: false // Set to true if server rendering is required
});
```

### 3. Priority Loading

Components will be categorized by loading priority:

1. **Critical** - Required for core functionality and initial render
2. **Important** - Required shortly after initial render
3. **Secondary** - Can be loaded on-demand or when idle
4. **Optional** - Only loaded when explicitly requested by user action

### 4. Specific Implementation Targets

#### Dashboard Components

The dashboard contains several heavy components that can be split:

```jsx
// Dashboard components to be dynamically imported
const ActivityFeed = dynamic(() => import('@components/dashboard/ActivityFeed'), {
  loading: () => <ActivityFeedSkeleton />,
});

const RecommendationPanel = dynamic(() => import('@components/dashboard/RecommendationPanel'), {
  loading: () => <RecommendationPanelSkeleton />,
});

const ExchangeStatusSection = dynamic(() => import('@components/dashboard/ExchangeStatusSection'), {
  loading: () => <StatusSectionSkeleton />,
});
```

#### Rich Media Components

Components with heavy dependencies or large rendering requirements:

```jsx
// Testimonials carousel with heavy animation libraries
const TestimonialsCarousel = dynamic(
  () => import('@components/testimonials/TestimonialsCarousel'),
  { ssr: false, loading: () => <TestimonialsSkeleton /> }
);

// Map component with heavy external dependencies
const LocationMap = dynamic(
  () => import('@components/location/Map'),
  { ssr: false, loading: () => <MapPlaceholder /> }
);
```

#### Form Components

Complex form components with validation libraries:

```jsx
// Skill form with validation libraries
const SkillForm = dynamic(
  () => import('@components/skills/SkillForm'),
  { loading: () => <FormSkeleton /> }
);
```

### 5. Prefetching Strategy

To balance performance and user experience, we'll implement intelligent prefetching:

- Prefetch likely next pages based on user navigation patterns
- Prefetch components when parent containers become visible
- Use `next/link` prefetching capabilities with the `prefetch` prop

```jsx
// Prefetch example
<Link href="/dashboard" prefetch>
  Go to Dashboard
</Link>

// Conditional prefetch based on viewport visibility
const prefetchComponent = () => {
  const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('@components/HeavyComponent'));
};

<InView onChange={(inView) => inView && prefetchComponent()}>
  <PlaceholderContent />
</InView>
```

### 6. Skeleton Loading States

For every dynamically loaded component, we'll create corresponding skeleton loading states:

```jsx
const SkillCardSkeleton = () => (
  <div className="animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-100 p-4">
    <div className="h-4 w-3/4 bg-gray-200 rounded mb-2"></div>
    <div className="h-3 w-1/2 bg-gray-200 rounded mb-4"></div>
    <div className="h-24 bg-gray-200 rounded mb-4"></div>
    <div className="flex justify-between">
      <div className="h-6 w-1/4 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>
      <div className="h-6 w-1/4 bg-gray-200 rounded"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Implementation Checklist

1. [x] Configure Next.js bundle analyzer to track improvements
2. [ ] Create skeleton loaders for all dynamically loaded components
3. [ ] Implement dynamic imports for dashboard components
4. [ ] Implement dynamic imports for media-rich components
5. [ ] Implement dynamic imports for complex form components
6. [ ] Add intersection observer logic for prefetching
7. [ ] Test and measure bundle size improvements
8. [ ] Verify there are no hydration issues caused by dynamic imports
9. [ ] Document performance metrics before and after implementation

## Performance Measurement

We'll measure the following metrics before and after implementation:

- Total JavaScript bundle size
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Lighthouse performance score

## Technical Considerations

- Server-side rendering compatibility
- Hydration errors prevention
- Browser compatibility
- Impact on SEO and crawler visibility

## Implementation Impact

Based on preliminary analysis, we expect:

- 30-40% reduction in initial JavaScript payload
- 20-25% improvement in Time to Interactive
- Improved performance on low-end devices and slow connections
- Minimal impact on users with high-speed connections
