## 3. Testing Methodology

### Structured Testing Approach
- **Guided Testing Scenarios**
  - Create task-based testing scripts
  - Define critical user journeys to test
  - Provide clear success criteria for each task
  - Balance directed testing with free exploration

- **Testing Phases**
  - Phase 1: Core functionality (account creation, profile setup)
  - Phase 2: Skill management and discovery
  - Phase 3: Communication and trade negotiation
  - Phase 4: Trade completion and feedback

### Feedback Collection
- **In-App Feedback Mechanisms**
  - Implement feedback button on all pages
  - Create simple feedback form with issue categorization
  - Add optional screenshot capability for bug reports
  - Include satisfaction rating system

- **Structured Feedback Sessions**
  - Schedule weekly group feedback calls
  - Conduct one-on-one interviews with key testers
  - Create feedback templates for consistent data collection
  - Record sessions for team review (with permission)

## 4. Resource Optimization

### Cost Management
- **Infrastructure Optimization**
  - Stay within free tier limits of all services
  - Implement database query optimization
  - Configure minimal resource allocation
  - Schedule regular cleanup of test data

- **Service Usage Limitations**
  - Cap email sending frequency
  - Use development API keys with usage limits
  - Disable or mock expensive third-party services
  - Monitor usage metrics regularly

### Performance Considerations
- **Load Management**
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Configure reasonable timeouts for operations
  - Optimize image and asset delivery
  - Monitor and address performance bottlenecks

## 5. Beta Testing Execution Plan

### Timeline and Milestones
- **Preparation Phase (1-2 weeks before launch)**
  - Complete infrastructure setup
  - Finalize test data generation
  - Prepare documentation and guides
  - Test all monitoring systems

- **Beta Testing Schedule**
  - Week 1: Initial rollout to 5-7 core testers
  - Week 2: Address critical issues, expand to 10-15 testers
  - Week 3: Full functionality testing with all testers
  - Week 4: Focused testing on refined features

### Issue Management
- **Bug Tracking Process**
  - Implement issue categorization system (critical, major, minor)
  - Create triage workflow for reported issues
  - Define resolution timeframes based on severity
  - Establish communication protocol for updates

- **Iteration Cycle**
  - Plan weekly code updates based on feedback
