# Import Path Resolution Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem

The SkillSwap MVP deployment to Vercel was failing with webpack errors related to module resolution:

```
Build Failed: Failed to compile.
./src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../lib/supabase'
```

Similar errors occurred for all auth-related components trying to import the Supabase client using relative paths.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a mismatch in path resolution between the local development environment and Vercel's build environment:

1. In local development, relative imports like `../../../lib/supabase` were resolving correctly
2. In Vercel's build environment, these paths couldn't be resolved, causing build failures
3. The nested directory structure of the auth components made relative paths particularly fragile

## Solution Implementation

The fix included two main changes:

### 1. Created a Direct Supabase Client Export

Created a new file at `src/lib/supabase.ts` that exposes the Supabase client directly from the lib root directory:

```typescript
// src/lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr';
import type { Database } from '@/types/supabase';

// ... client implementation ...

export const supabase = /* supabase client implementation */;
export async function getCurrentUser() { /* ... */ }
export async function signUp(email: string, password: string) { /* ... */ }
export async function signIn(email: string, password: string) { /* ... */ }
export async function signOut() { /* ... */ }

export default supabase;
```

This provides a stable, direct import path for any component needing the Supabase client.

### 2. Updated Import Paths in Auth Components

Changed all relative imports to use the path alias `@/lib/supabase` in the following files:

- `src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx`
- `src/app/auth/verify/page.tsx`
- `src/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`
- `src/app/auth/resend-verification/page.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`

For example:
```typescript
// Before
import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';

// After
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplified Imports**: No need to count directory levels with `../../../`
2. **Consistency**: All components use the same import pattern
3. **Portability**: Components can be moved without breaking imports
4. **Vercel Compatibility**: Path aliases are properly resolved in Vercel's build environment

## Best Practices Moving Forward

1. Prefer path aliases (e.g., `@/lib/...`) over deep relative paths
2. For critical shared utilities like authentication, create direct exports at shallow paths
3. Test builds with `npm run build` locally before deploying
4. When seeing path resolution errors, consider centralizing the resource for easier access

This solution ensures the SkillSwap MVP can be successfully deployed to Vercel without path resolution issues.
