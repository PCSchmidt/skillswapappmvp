## May 8, 2025 - Dashboard Implementation Plan

Based on our completion of the core skill matching functionality, we're now ready to begin work on the user dashboard implementation (Phase 7). The dashboard will provide users with a centralized view of their ongoing exchanges, activity history, and personalized recommendations.

Key components to develop:
1. Main dashboard layout with responsive grid system
2. Activity feed showing recent interactions
3. Exchange status tracker with filtering options
4. Analytics section for skill exchange metrics
5. Recommendation panel with personalized matches
6. Quick actions for common user tasks

We'll build these components using our established design system and component patterns, ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.

## May 8, 2025 - Messaging System & Review Implementation

Today we implemented two major components that complete our core skill exchange functionality:

1. **Messaging System**
   - Created a comprehensive messaging component for user communication
   - Implemented real-time chat interface with proper UI states:
     - Loading states for initial message fetching
     - Sending animation for message submission
     - Error handling for failed message delivery
   - Added user presence indicators to show online status
   - Implemented message timestamps with human-readable format
   - Created responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

2. **Review System**
   - Built a review submission form for completed skill exchanges
   - Implemented star rating system with interactive UI
   - Added validation for rating and comment fields
   - Created loading states for form submission
   - Ensured proper error handling and user feedback

3. **Type Updates**
   - Enhanced TypeScript definitions to support new features
   - Added interfaces for:
     - User profiles
     - Skill details
     - Messaging
     - Reviews
     - Notifications
     - User settings

4. **Progress Documentation Updates**
   - Updated implementation tracker to reflect completed components
   - Marked completed tasks for messaging system and review implementation

These components, along with our previously implemented matching algorithm, now complete the core user interaction cycle for skill exchanges, allowing users to discover matches, communicate, and provide feedback after exchanges.

The next step will focus on implementing the user dashboard to provide a centralized view of all user activities, ongoing exchanges, and personalized recommendations.

## May 8, 2025 - ESLint Configuration Update

Fixed ESLint configuration issues in the project by updating the `.eslintrc.cjs` file to modern ESLint standards. The previous configuration was using deprecated options which caused linting errors during commit operations. The solution involved:

1. Installing `eslint-plugin-import` dependency
2. Updating configuration format to use modern ESLint v8.57.0 syntax
3. Adding proper import resolution for TypeScript files
4. Configuring import order rules for better code organization

Detailed documentation was added in `docs/eslint_dependency_fix.md` to explain the changes and provide guidance for future maintenance.
