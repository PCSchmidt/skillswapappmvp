## 2025-05-03: Email Notification System Implementation

Today I implemented a comprehensive email notification system for the SkillSwap MVP. This feature extends the existing in-app notification system to deliver important updates directly to users' email inboxes, improving engagement and keeping users informed even when they're not actively using the platform.

2. **Email Templates**
   - Built responsive HTML email templates with consistent branding
   - Created `baseTemplate.ts` with common layout and styling
   - Implemented specific templates for different notification types:
     - Trade proposal notifications
     - New message notifications
     - Rating notifications
   - Designed templates to work across various email clients

3. **Supabase Edge Function**

### Integration with Notification System:

   - Documented testing procedures and future enhancement options

This email notification system enhances the user experience by ensuring users never miss important updates about their trades, messages, or ratings, even when they're not actively using the platform. The preference system gives users control over which emails they receive, helping to prevent notification fatigue.

## 2025-05-02: Notification System Implementation

     - New messages
     - New ratings
   - Each trigger automatically creates and formats appropriate notifications

3. **Helper Functions**

## 2025-05-02: Ratings and Reviews System Implementation

Today I implemented a comprehensive ratings and reviews system for the SkillSwap MVP. This feature allows users to rate and review each other after completing trades, providing valuable social proof and trust signals for the community.

### Components Created:

1. **StarRating Component**
   - Reusable star rating component with configurable size, interactivity, and color
   - Supports both display-only and interactive modes
   - Includes hover states and keyboard navigation

2. **RatingForm Component**

   - Validates that the trade is completed before allowing ratings
   - Prevents duplicate ratings for the same trade
   - Supports public and private review options

3. **RatingsList Component**
   - Displays ratings with user information, star rating, and timestamp
   - Supports compact and expanded modes
   - Includes empty state for users without ratings

4. **Ratings Page**

### Security Considerations:

1. **Row-Level Security**
   - Public ratings are visible to everyone
   - Private ratings are only visible to the rater and ratee
   - Users can only rate trades they participated in
   - Users can only rate completed trades

### Next Steps:

1. Enhance ratings dashboard with filtering and sorting options
2. Add rating statistics to the dashboard
3. Implement email notifications for new ratings
4. Add admin capability to moderate inappropriate reviews

Overall, the ratings system provides a solid foundation for trust and reputation in the SkillSwap community, allowing users to make informed decisions about potential trade partners.
