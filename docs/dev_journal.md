## 2025-05-02: Notification System Implementation

Today I implemented a comprehensive notification system for the SkillSwap MVP. This feature allows users to receive real-time notifications about important events like trade proposals, status changes, new messages, and ratings.

### Database Implementation:

1. **Notifications Table**
   - Created a new table to store user notifications with fields for type, content, read status, and metadata
   - Added appropriate indexes for efficient queries
   - Implemented row-level security policies to ensure users can only see their own notifications

2. **Database Triggers**
   - Created automatic triggers for various events:
     - New trade proposals
     - Trade status changes (accepted, declined, completed)
     - New messages
     - New ratings
   - Each trigger automatically creates and formats appropriate notifications

3. **Helper Functions**
   - Added functions for marking notifications as read/unread
   - Implemented notification cleanup functionality
   - Created counter for unread notifications in the user profile

### Frontend Components:

1. **NotificationItem Component**
   - Displays a single notification with appropriate styling based on type
   - Shows relevant icons and formatting based on notification priority
   - Includes "mark as read" and "delete" actions

2. **NotificationList Component**
   - Displays a list of notifications
   - Supports filtering options
   - Includes empty states and loading indicators
   - Provides batch actions like "mark all as read" and "clear all"

3. **NotificationDropdown Component**
   - Appears when clicking the notification bell in the navbar
   - Shows recent notifications in a popup
   - Provides a link to the full notifications page

4. **Notifications Page**
   - Created a dedicated page for viewing all notifications
   - Implemented filtering by read/unread status and notification type
   - Added real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### Navbar Integration:

1. **Notification Bell**
   - Added notification bell icon to the navbar
   - Shows a badge with unread notification count
   - Updates count in real-time via Supabase subscriptions

### Real-time Features:

1. **Live Updates**
   - Implemented Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant notification delivery
   - Updates unread counts without page refresh
   - Auto-refreshes notification lists when new notifications arrive

### Type Safety:

1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Added notification types to the Supabase type definitions
   - Ensured type safety throughout the notification components

This notification system enhances user engagement by keeping users informed about important events in the platform. The real-time nature ensures users never miss updates about their trades, messages, or ratings.

## 2025-05-02: Ratings and Reviews System Implementation

Today I implemented a comprehensive ratings and reviews system for the SkillSwap MVP. This feature allows users to rate and review each other after completing trades, providing valuable social proof and trust signals for the community.

### Components Created:

1. **StarRating Component**
   - Reusable star rating component with configurable size, interactivity, and color
   - Supports both display-only and interactive modes
   - Includes hover states and keyboard navigation

2. **RatingForm Component**
   - Form for submitting ratings and reviews
   - Validates that the trade is completed before allowing ratings
   - Prevents duplicate ratings for the same trade
   - Supports public and private review options

3. **RatingsList Component**
   - Displays ratings with user information, star rating, and timestamp
   - Supports compact and expanded modes
   - Includes empty state for users without ratings

4. **Ratings Page**
   - Created `/ratings/[trade_id]` page for submitting ratings
   - Shows submitted ratings from both trade participants
   - Links back to trade details

### Database Changes:

1. **Created Ratings Table**
   - Added migration file for ratings table
   - Includes fields for trade reference, user IDs, rating score, review text
   - Added appropriate indexes and security policies

2. **User Profile Integration**
   - Added average rating calculation to user profiles
   - Display ratings on user profile pages

### Trade Integration:

1. **Updated Trade Details Page**
   - Added rating button on completed trades
   - Linked rating button to ratings page

### Security Considerations:

1. **Row-Level Security**
   - Public ratings are visible to everyone
   - Private ratings are only visible to the rater and ratee
   - Users can only rate trades they participated in
   - Users can only rate completed trades

### Next Steps:

1. Enhance ratings dashboard with filtering and sorting options
2. Add rating statistics to the dashboard
3. Implement email notifications for new ratings
4. Add admin capability to moderate inappropriate reviews

Overall, the ratings system provides a solid foundation for trust and reputation in the SkillSwap community, allowing users to make informed decisions about potential trade partners.
