### Email Notification System Update

Today I completed the implementation of all planned email templates for the notification system. The final two templates were:

1. **Trade Status Cancelled Template**: Implemented a responsive email template to notify users when a trade has been cancelled. The template includes details about the cancelled trade, the reason for cancellation (if provided), and a call-to-action button to view their trade history.

2. **Trade Status Completed Template**: Created a template for completed trades with a positive, congratulatory tone. This template includes trade details, an option to rate the trading partner, and suggestions for future trades.

Both templates follow our established email design system with consistent styling, clear instructions, and accessibility considerations for different email clients. Each template includes both button and text link options for maximum compatibility.

The remaining work would involve connecting the email system to Supabase Edge Functions for actual delivery. We've already built all the necessary infrastructure including:

- Email service integration with the notification system
- User preference controls for all email types
- Database tables for storing preferences
- Edge function setup for sending emails

### Notification Settings Interface

I also finished implementing the NotificationSettingsPage component that provides a comprehensive interface for users to manage all their notification preferences including:

- Channel preferences (email, push, in-app)
- Trade notifications (proposals, acceptances, declines, cancellations, completions)
- Communication notifications (messages, ratings)
- Digest settings (daily, weekly)

The UI uses our design system components with tabs for organizing different settings categories, toggle switches for enabling/disabling preferences, and proper feedback mechanisms for saving changes.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the Supabase Edge Functions for email delivery
2. Implement frequency controls for notification digests
3. Add email analytics tracking (opens, clicks)
4. Set up automated testing for the notification delivery system
