   - Implementing interaction mechanisms between users
   - Creating skill request and offer workflows

3. **Matching Algorithm Development**
   - Building the complementary skill matching logic
   - Implementing scoring and ranking system
   - Creating recommendation engine for skill matches

4. **Personal Dashboard**
   - Developing user-specific dashboard
   - Creating activity tracking and history features
   - Implementing notification systems

### Technical Approach:
- Building with TypeScript and React following established patterns
- Using Supabase for backend storage and real-time features
- Implementing responsive design following our design system
- Creating reusable components for consistency

## May 8, 2025 - Phase 5 Completion: Interactive Elements

Today we successfully completed Phase 5 of the SkillSwap MVP development, implementing all the planned interactive elements. 

### Key Accomplishments:

   - Created a reusable search component with query handling
   - Implemented debounce functionality for better performance
   - Connected search to URL parameters for shareable results

2. **Skill Filtering System**
   - Implemented comprehensive filtering options:
     - Categories
     - Experience levels
     - Offering/seeking type
     - Location types
   - Added filter state management that updates URL parameters

3. **Auth Preview Component**
   - Created a component to showcase benefits of signing up
   - Added links to authentication flow
   - Designed for conversion optimization

4. **Search Results Page**
   - Built a complete search results page with:
     - Filtering sidebar
     - Results grid with pagination
     - Sorting options
     - No-results state handling
     - Loading states

5. **Integration**
   - Connected all components to create a cohesive user experience
   - Ensured proper state management between components
   - Implemented URL parameter handling for shareable links

### Technical Notes:

- Used React hooks for state management across components
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Created responsive layouts that work across device sizes
- Used mock data that simulates the expected API response structure

### Next Phase:

Moving forward to Phase 6, we'll be focusing on:
