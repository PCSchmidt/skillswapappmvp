## 2025-05-02: Ratings and Reviews System Implementation

Today I implemented a comprehensive ratings and reviews system for the SkillSwap MVP. This feature allows users to rate and review each other after completing trades, providing valuable social proof and trust signals for the community.

### Components Created:

1. **StarRating Component**
   - Reusable star rating component with configurable size, interactivity, and color
   - Supports both display-only and interactive modes
   - Includes hover states and keyboard navigation

2. **RatingForm Component**
   - Form for submitting ratings and reviews
   - Validates that the trade is completed before allowing ratings
   - Prevents duplicate ratings for the same trade
   - Supports public and private review options

3. **RatingsList Component**
   - Displays ratings with user information, star rating, and timestamp
   - Supports compact and expanded modes
   - Includes empty state for users without ratings

4. **Ratings Page**
   - Created `/ratings/[trade_id]` page for submitting ratings
   - Shows submitted ratings from both trade participants
   - Links back to trade details

### Database Changes:

1. **Created Ratings Table**
   - Added migration file for ratings table
   - Includes fields for trade reference, user IDs, rating score, review text
   - Added appropriate indexes and security policies

2. **User Profile Integration**
   - Added average rating calculation to user profiles
   - Display ratings on user profile pages

### Trade Integration:

1. **Updated Trade Details Page**
   - Added rating button on completed trades
   - Linked rating button to ratings page

### Security Considerations:

1. **Row-Level Security**
   - Public ratings are visible to everyone
   - Private ratings are only visible to the rater and ratee
   - Users can only rate trades they participated in
   - Users can only rate completed trades

### Next Steps:

1. Enhance ratings dashboard with filtering and sorting options
2. Add rating statistics to the dashboard
3. Implement email notifications for new ratings
4. Add admin capability to moderate inappropriate reviews

Overall, the ratings system provides a solid foundation for trust and reputation in the SkillSwap community, allowing users to make informed decisions about potential trade partners.
