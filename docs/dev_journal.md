### Next Steps in Testing:

1. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on each commit
   - Establish minimum coverage thresholds
   - Add performance benchmarking for critical paths

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Implement end-to-end tests for email workflows
   - Add integration tests with actual database schemas
   - Create snapshot tests for email templates

This testing work ensures the reliability of our email notification system, giving us confidence that users will receive appropriate emails based on their preferences and that the system will handle errors gracefully. The test suite also provides a safety net for future enhancements, allowing us to quickly identify regressions.

## 2025-05-03: Email Notification System Implementation

   - Users can only rate completed trades

### Next Steps:

1. Enhance ratings dashboard with filtering and sorting options
2. Add rating statistics to the dashboard
3. Implement email notifications for new ratings
4. Add admin capability to moderate inappropriate reviews

Overall, the ratings system provides a solid foundation for trust and reputation in the SkillSwap community, allowing users to make informed decisions about potential trade partners.
