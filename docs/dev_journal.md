The next step will focus on implementing the user dashboard to provide a centralized view of all user activities, ongoing exchanges, and personalized recommendations.

## May 8, 2025 - ESLint Configuration Update

Fixed ESLint configuration issues in the project by updating the `.eslintrc.cjs` file to modern ESLint standards. The previous configuration was using deprecated options which caused linting errors during commit operations. The solution involved:
