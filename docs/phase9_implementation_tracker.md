- ✅ Implement Next.js Image component across the application
  - ✅ Created reusable OptimizedImage component with standardized props
  - ✅ Added support for multiple image sizes and aspect ratios
  - ✅ Implemented skeleton loading states
- ✅ Configure image formats and responsive sizing
  - ✅ Defined standard size presets (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, full)
  - ✅ Added support for custom dimensions
- ✅ Add proper image placeholders and loading states
  - ✅ Implemented blur placeholder with default fallback
  - ✅ Added animated skeleton loader option

### Data Fetching & Caching
- ✅ Created data fetching and caching strategy document
- [ ] Implement SWR for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching
- [ ] Create custom hooks for common data operations
- [ ] Set up cache invalidation and persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates for common actions

## Caching & CDN

- [ ] Configure Vercel edge caching
- [ ] Set up proper cache control headers
- [ ] Create environment-specific caching strategies

## Security & Dependencies

  - [ ] Next.js security vulnerabilities (Server-Side Request Forgery, Cache Poisoning, DoS)
  - [ ] cookie package vulnerabilities in authentication modules
  - [ ] Prototype Pollution in minimist (used by jest-coverage-badges)
- [ ] Run npm audit fix for safe updates
- [ ] Evaluate breaking changes required by npm audit fix --force
- [ ] Document security improvements and remaining concerns

## Production Configuration

- [ ] Configure environment-specific builds
- [ ] Update deployment scripts for production
- [ ] Create production deployment checklist

## Final User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Add loading states for better user feedback
