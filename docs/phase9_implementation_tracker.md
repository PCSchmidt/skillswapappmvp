# Phase 9 Implementation Tracker: Testing & Optimization

This document tracks the progress of Phase 9 implementation, which focuses on comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and final preparations for production deployment.

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Analysis
- ✅ Integrated Next.js Bundle Analyzer
- ✅ Added custom scripts for analyzing bundles (analyze, analyze:server, analyze:browser)
- ✅ Updated next.config.js to support bundle analysis when ANALYZE=true

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Error Boundary System
- ✅ Created ErrorBoundary component to catch and handle React component errors
- ✅ Created ErrorProvider wrapper with Sentry integration
- ✅ Integrated ErrorProvider in the application layout
- ✅ Added custom Next.js error page for route error handling
- ✅ Added custom 404 not-found page for better user experience

## Beta Testing Preparation

### Beta Testing Strategy
- ✅ Created comprehensive beta testing strategy document
- ✅ Defined technical infrastructure requirements for beta deployment
- ✅ Outlined beta tester management process and testing methodology
- ✅ Established resource optimization guidelines for beta environment
- ✅ Defined post-beta evaluation criteria and transition planning

## Testing Setup

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Configure Jest with coverage reporting
- [ ] Add test badges to README.md
- [ ] Add critical unit tests for core functionality:
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Skill matching
  - [ ] Notification system
  - [ ] Database interactions

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Set up Cypress for E2E testing
- [ ] Create test fixtures and data mocks
- [ ] Implement critical user flow tests:
  - [ ] Registration flow
  - [ ] Skill listing and searching
  - [ ] Matching and connecting with other users

- [ ] Optimize image loading and processing
- [ ] Review and optimize API calls and data fetching

### Lazy Loading
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Add loading states for async components
- [ ] Optimize component tree rendering

## Caching & CDN

- [ ] Configure Vercel edge caching
- [ ] Implement SWR for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching
- [ ] Set up proper cache control headers

## Production Configuration

- [ ] Configure environment-specific builds
- [ ] Update deployment scripts for production
- [ ] Create production deployment checklist

## Final User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Add loading states for better user feedback
- [ ] Implement skeleton loaders for content
- [ ] Add fallback states for empty data scenarios
