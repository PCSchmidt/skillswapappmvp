# Supabase SSR Integration Fix

## Problem

During deployment, the application was encountering build errors related to the Supabase client integration:

```
Can't resolve '@/lib/supabase/client'
```

This error occurred because:

1. The project was using an older version of the Supabase client libraries
2. Path aliases weren't properly resolving during the build process
3. The Supabase client imports were not type-safe

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

### 1. Installed the new SSR package

```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr
```

This package is the newer recommended replacement for the deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package, specifically designed for Next.js Server-Side Rendering.

### 2. Updated the Supabase client exports

In `src/lib/supabase.ts`, we modified the file to properly export both the standard and cached Supabase clients:

```typescript
/**
 * Centralized Supabase Client Export
 * 
 * This file re-exports all Supabase client implementations and individual clients
 * to provide a consistent import pattern across the codebase.
 */

// Re-export all exports from the supabase directory
export * from './supabase/index';

// Import and re-export both client implementations
import { supabaseClient } from './supabase/client';
import { supabaseCachedClient } from './supabase/cachedClient';

// Export the default client (non-cached version)
export const supabase = supabaseClient;

// Export the cached client with a different name for clarity
export const supabaseCached = supabaseCachedClient;
```

This ensures all imports throughout the application work correctly, providing better clarity about which client is being used.

### 3. Added proper typing to middleware.ts

We updated the middleware.ts file to properly type the Supabase client:

```typescript
// Added import
import type { Database } from '@/types/supabase';

// Updated client creation to include type
const supabase = createServerClient<Database>(
  supabaseUrl,
  supabaseAnonKey,
  {
    cookies: {
      // ... cookie handlers
    }
  }
);
```

This change ensures the middleware uses the correct Database type definition, making the Supabase client operations type-safe.

## Additional Observations

While fixing the Supabase integration, we noticed several unrelated Next.js client component issues with the error:

```
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
  {variant: "primary", onClick: function, children: ...}
                                ^^^^^^^^
If you need interactivity, consider converting part of this to a Client Component.
```

These errors occur because of React Server Component limitations - specifically, event handlers cannot be passed to Server Components. This is a separate issue that would need addressing in a future update by:

1. Converting appropriate components to Client Components using the "use client" directive
2. Using the ButtonWrapper or ClientComponentWrapper components for interactive elements

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Ensure all your Button components are properly wrapped**: Use the ButtonWrapper component for any buttons that need onClick handlers
2. **Review Server and Client component boundaries**: Ensure event handlers are only used in Client Components
3. **Update Sentry integration**: The build shows warnings about BrowserTracing and Replay not being exported from '@sentry/nextjs'
