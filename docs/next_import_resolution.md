# Next.js Import Resolution Analysis

## Problem Identification

The deployment is failing on Vercel with import resolution errors even though the build succeeds locally. The errors consistently show:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@lib/supabase'
```

This suggests that the path aliases defined in tsconfig.json and webpack configuration in next.config.js are not being properly recognized during the Vercel build process.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in how Next.js and Vercel handle path aliases. There's a mismatch between:

1. How aliases work in our **local environment** (succeeding with `@lib/supabase`)
2. How aliases are processed in the **Vercel build environment** (failing with the same path)

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Use Relative Imports Instead of Aliases

Replace all instances of `@lib/supabase` with relative imports that don't rely on path aliases:

```javascript
// Change from
import { supabase } from '@lib/supabase';

// To
import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabase';
```

### 2. Modify Module Resolution Strategy in Next.config.js

We might need to enhance the webpack configuration in next.config.js to ensure consistent path resolution:

```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  // More explicit module resolution
  config.resolve.modules = [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'), 'node_modules', ...config.resolve.modules || []];
  
  // Existing aliases
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/'),
    '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components/'),
    '@lib': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/lib/'),
    '@types': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/types/'),
    '@ai': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/ai/')
  };
  
  return config;
}
```

### 3. Use Next.js Native Path Aliases (jsconfig.json / tsconfig.json)

According to [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases), Next.js has built-in support for path aliases through the tsconfig.json/jsconfig.json `paths` property. We may need to ensure the webpack configuration is not overriding this built-in behavior.

## Recommended Approach

The most reliable solution would be to use relative imports for critical components that are causing build failures. This approach is less elegant but more robust across different build environments.

For a longer-term fix, we should investigate how Vercel's build environment is processing our webpack configuration and whether there's any specific requirements for path alias resolution in production deployments.

## Next Steps

1. Modify the imports in the auth components to use relative paths instead of aliases
2. Test the changes with a local build
3. Deploy to Vercel to verify the solution works in their build environment
