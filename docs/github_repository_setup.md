# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This document provides instructions for configuring the GitHub repository settings to ensure proper security and discoverability.

## Branch Protection

The master branch is currently unprotected, which poses security risks. Follow these steps to enable branch protection:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub (https://github.com/PCSchmidt/skillswapappmvp)
2. Click on "Settings" in the top navigation
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Branches"
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
5. For "Branch name pattern", enter `master`
6. Enable the following settings:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators
   - ✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches
7. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

This will prevent direct pushes to the master branch and ensure all changes go through a pull request review process.

## Repository Metadata

The repository is currently missing important metadata. Follow these steps to add it:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub (https://github.com/PCSchmidt/skillswapappmvp)
2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) next to "About" on the right sidebar
3. Add the following information:
   - **Description**: "A platform for trading skills in local communities, facilitating skill exchange without monetary transactions"
   - **Website**: [Your project website or demo URL, if available]
   - **Topics**: Add relevant topics such as:
     - nextjs
     - typescript
     - supabase
     - tailwindcss
     - skill-exchange
     - community-platform
     - barter-system
     - react
4. Click "Save changes"

## Repository Visibility

Currently, the repository is set to "Private." If you plan to make this an open-source project or want to share it with specific collaborators:

1. Go to repository "Settings"
2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Choose the appropriate option:
   - Keep it private if it's a proprietary project
   - Make it public if it's intended to be open source
   - Make it internal if you want it visible only to organization members

## Pull Request Template

Consider adding a pull request template to standardize PR submissions:

1. Create a file at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Add a structured template with sections like:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue
   - Testing performed
   - Checklist of tasks completed

## Merge Strategy

Set a default merge strategy for the repository:

1. Go to repository "Settings"
2. Under "Pull Requests", select the preferred default merge strategy:
   - Create a merge commit (preserves all commits)
   - Squash merging (combines all commits into one)
   - Rebase merging (places commits on top of the base branch)

## Release Process

Consider setting up a formalized release process:

1. Use GitHub Releases to tag stable versions
2. Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
3. Include detailed release notes for each version

## Actions Permissions

1. Go to "Settings" > "Actions" > "General"
2. Configure workflow permissions:
   - Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions" if your GitHub Actions need to write to the repository
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" if automated PR creation is part of your workflow

Implementing these changes will improve the repository's security, organization, and professionalism.
