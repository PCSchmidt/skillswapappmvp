## ðŸŽ­ Mock Feature Strategy

### 1. Payment System Mock
```typescript
// Mock payment interface that looks real but doesn't process
const MockPaymentForm = () => (
  <div className="border-2 border-dashed border-orange-300 p-6 rounded-lg bg-orange-50">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-4">
      <CreditCard className="w-5 h-5 text-orange-600" />
      <span className="font-semibold text-orange-800">Payment Integration (Demo Mode)</span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-orange-700 mb-4">
      This would integrate with Stripe for real payments. Currently in demo mode.
    </p>
    {/* Real-looking payment form that doesn't actually charge */}
    <PaymentFormMock />
    <button 
      onClick={() => showSuccessMessage("Demo: Payment would be processed here")}
      className="w-full bg-orange-600 text-white py-2 rounded hover:bg-orange-700"
    >
      Process Payment (Demo)
    </button>
  </div>
)
```

### 2. Video Call Integration Mock
```typescript
const VideoCallMock = () => (
  <div className="border-2 border-dashed border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg bg-blue-50">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-4">
      <Video className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600" />
      <span className="font-semibold text-blue-800">Video Call (Demo Mode)</span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-700 mb-4">
      Would integrate with Zoom/Google Meet API. Currently simulated.
    </p>
    <button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
      Start Demo Call
    </button>
  </div>
)
```

### 3. SMS Notifications Mock
```typescript
const NotificationMock = () => {
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([])
  
  const addMockNotification = (message) => {
    setNotifications(prev => [...prev, {
      id: Date.now(),
      message,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      type: 'sms_mock'
    }])
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="border-2 border-dashed border-green-300 p-4 rounded-lg bg-green-50">
      <p className="text-sm text-green-700">
        ðŸ“± SMS would be sent: "{message}"

.mock-feature {
  border: 2px dashed #f59e0b;
  background: #fef3c7;
  position: relative;
}

.mock-feature::before {
  content: "DEMO MODE";
