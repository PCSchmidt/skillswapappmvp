# SkillSwap Barter System Rules

This document defines the principles, guidelines, and rules governing the barter system within SkillSwap, ensuring fair, transparent, and valuable skill exchanges.

## Core Principles

1. **Time-Based Exchange**: The primary currency in SkillSwap is time, with the default assumption that one hour of a skill is exchangeable for one hour of another skill, regardless of the specific skills involved.

2. **Mutual Value**: Both participants in a trade should receive comparable value from the exchange, taking into account skill level, preparation time, and other relevant factors.

3. **Transparency**: All aspects of a trade should be clearly defined and agreed upon in advance, including skill details, time commitment, and logistics.

4. **Respect**: All exchanges should be conducted with mutual respect for each participant's time, expertise, and boundaries.

5. **Safety**: Trades should prioritize the physical and emotional safety of all participants.

## Exchange Structure

### Time Units

- **Standard Unit**: 1 hour of instruction/collaboration
- **Minimum Exchange**: 30 minutes
- **Maximum Single Session**: 4 hours (longer exchanges should be split into multiple sessions)
- **Preparation Time**: Should be discussed and factored into the exchange when relevant

### Skill Level Adjustments

While time is the base unit of exchange, skill level can be factored in through the following adjustments:

| Provider Level | Recipient Level | Suggested Adjustment |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Expert         | Beginner        | 1:1.25 - 1:1.5 ratio |
| Advanced       | Beginner        | 1:1.15 - 1:1.25 ratio |
| Intermediate   | Beginner        | 1:1 - 1:1.15 ratio |
| Beginner       | Beginner        | 1:1 ratio |
| Expert         | Intermediate    | 1:1.15 - 1:1.25 ratio |
| Advanced       | Intermediate    | 1:1 - 1:1.15 ratio |
| Intermediate   | Intermediate    | 1:1 ratio |
| Expert         | Advanced        | 1:1 - 1:1.15 ratio |
| Advanced       | Advanced        | 1:1 ratio |
| Expert         | Expert          | 1:1 ratio |

Example: An expert chef might offer 1 hour of cooking instruction in exchange for 1.25 hours of beginner guitar lessons.

### Additional Factors

The following factors may also be considered when determining fair exchange rates:

1. **Material Costs**: Any materials required for the skill exchange should be:
   - Provided by the recipient
   - Reimbursed to the provider
   - Factored into the exchange rate

2. **Travel Time**: For in-person exchanges, consider:
   - Meeting at a mutually convenient location
   - Factoring travel time into the exchange (e.g., 15 minutes of travel = 15 minutes of skill time)
   - Alternating meeting locations to share travel burden

3. **Preparation Requirements**: Skills requiring significant preparation should account for prep time:
   - Cooking (shopping, prep work)
   - Teaching (lesson planning)
   - Specialized setups (equipment arrangement)

## Trade Lifecycle

### 1. Proposal Phase

- **Initiator**: Any user can propose a trade
- **Required Details**:
  - Skill offered (with level and description)
  - Skill requested (with level and description)
  - Proposed time commitment
  - Preferred schedule
  - Location preference (in-person or remote)
  - Any additional requirements or notes

### 2. Negotiation Phase

- **Counteroffers**: Recipients can accept, decline, or counter the proposal
- **Adjustments**: Terms can be modified including:
  - Time commitment
  - Specific skills
  - Schedule
  - Location
  - Exchange ratio
- **Clarifications**: Both parties can request additional information

### 3. Agreement Phase

- **Formal Acceptance**: Both parties must explicitly accept the final terms
- **Scheduling**: Specific dates and times are confirmed
- **Location Details**: Precise meeting details are shared (if in-person)
- **Cancellation Policy**: Agreement on how to handle potential cancellations

### 4. Execution Phase

- **Check-in**: Confirmation shortly before the scheduled exchange
- **Exchange**: The actual skill sharing session(s)
- **Flexibility**: Minor adjustments can be made with mutual agreement
- **Documentation**: Optional recording or notes (with consent)

### 5. Completion Phase

- **Fulfillment Confirmation**: Both parties confirm the exchange was completed
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Participants rate and review each other
- **Next Steps**: Option to schedule follow-up sessions or new exchanges

## Multi-Party Trades

In cases where direct two-party exchanges aren't possible, multi-party trades are supported:

### Three-Way Exchange Example
1. User A teaches photography to User B
2. User B teaches coding to User C
3. User C teaches cooking to User A

Requirements:
- All participants must agree to the terms
- The system will help track and balance the hours across participants
- Each segment follows the standard barter rules

## Dispute Resolution

If participants encounter issues during a trade, the following resolution process applies:

### Level 1: Direct Resolution
- Participants are encouraged to communicate and resolve minor issues directly

### Level 2: Mediated Resolution
- For unresolved disputes, participants can request system mediation
- A neutral third party reviews the case and suggests a fair resolution
- Recommendations are non-binding but encouraged

### Level 3: Platform Intervention
- For serious issues (safety concerns, code of conduct violations)
- Platform administrators may intervene
- May result in warnings, trade cancellation, or account actions

## Safety Guidelines

### In-Person Exchanges

- **First Meetings**: Should occur in public places
- **Personal Information**: Share only what's necessary for the exchange
- **Emergency Contact**: Consider informing someone about your meeting details
- **Boundaries**: Clearly communicate and respect personal boundaries
- **Right to Refuse**: Either party can end an exchange if they feel uncomfortable or unsafe

### Remote Exchanges

- **Platform**: Use the built-in SkillSwap video platform when possible
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of what's visible in your background
- **Recording**: Only with explicit consent from all participants
- **Technical Issues**: Have a backup plan for connection problems

## Special Scenarios

### Long-Term Exchanges

For ongoing relationships where the same skills are exchanged regularly:

- Consider establishing a regular schedule
- Agree on terms that apply to the entire series
- Periodically review and adjust if needed
- Track cumulative hours to ensure balance over time

### Group Exchanges

When a skill is taught to multiple recipients simultaneously:

- Provider receives credit for each participant-hour
- Participants each "pay" their full time commitment
- Group size should be limited based on the skill type
- Quality of instruction should not be diluted

### Skill Disparities

When skills have significantly different perceived market values:

- Focus on the value to the specific participants rather than market rates
- Consider skill level adjustments as outlined above
- If agreement cannot be reached, consider a partial cash supplement (premium feature)
- Remember that the platform's core value is in the exchange of time and knowledge

## Ethical Considerations

### Prohibited Exchanges

The following types of skills/services are not permitted:

- Anything illegal or harmful
- Professional services requiring licensing (medical, legal, etc.)
- Services traditionally associated with significant power imbalances
- Exchanges that violate the platform's code of conduct

### Professional Boundaries

- Users offering skills related to their profession should:
  - Clearly distinguish casual knowledge sharing from professional services
  - Not offer services they're not qualified to provide
  - Be transparent about their qualifications and limitations
  - Avoid creating client/professional relationships through the platform

## Regional Variations

While these core rules apply globally, certain adjustments may be made for regional contexts:

- Cultural norms around time and punctuality
- Local regulations regarding skill sharing
- Regional customs regarding hospitality and exchange
- Seasonal considerations for certain activities

## Rule Updates

These barter rules will evolve based on:

- User feedback and suggestions
- Observed trade patterns
- Dispute resolution outcomes
- Platform growth and feature additions
