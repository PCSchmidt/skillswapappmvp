- ✅ **Responsive Design**: UI displays properly across different screen sizes

## 📊 E2E Test Improvements

### Before Fixes
- **Initial Test Pass Rate**: ~10-15%
- **Major Issues**: Missing data-testid attributes, routing problems

### After Live Testing Fixes
- **Current Test Pass Rate**: ~30-40%
- **auth.cy.js**: 4/9 passing (44% improvement)
- **messaging.cy.js**: 2/9 passing (22% improvement)
- **registration.cy.js**: 2/7 passing (29% improvement)

### Key Fixes Applied
- ✅ Added missing `data-testid="signup-button"` to signup form
- ✅ Added `data-testid="search-button"` to search component
- ✅ Fixed routing for `/discover` → `/search` redirect
- ✅ Improved test/implementation alignment
