# SkillSwap Platform Enhancement Plan

## Current Status & Immediate Fixes ✅

### 1. Password Visibility Toggle - IMPLEMENTED
- Added eye icon to login form for password visibility
- Users can now see their password while typing to verify accuracy
- Improves UX and reduces login errors

### 2. Discover Route Fix - IMPLEMENTED  
- Fixed "Discover Skills" to redirect to `/skills/browse` instead of search
- Now shows proper skills browsing page with examples and functionality
- Users see actual skill listings instead of "Skill Not Found"

## Database Integration & Skill Management ✅

### Skills ARE Captured in Database
**Confirmation**: The platform fully captures skills in the database with these features:

1. **User Skills Table**: Stores user's offered/wanted skills with proficiency levels
2. **Skills Catalog**: Central repository of all skills with categories
3. **Search Functionality**: Skills are searchable by title, description, category
4. **Skill Creation**: Users can create new skills if they don't exist

### API Endpoints Available:
- `POST /api/skills` - Create new skills in the catalog
- `GET /api/skills` - Search and filter skills 
- `POST /api/user-skills` - Add skills to user profile
- `GET /api/user-skills` - Retrieve user's skills

## Platform Flexibility & Scalability 🚀

### Unlimited Skills Support
The platform is designed for unlimited skills:

1. **Dynamic Skill Creation**: Users can create any skill not in the catalog
2. **Category System**: Flexible categorization (Technology, Arts, Business, etc.)
3. **Subcategories**: Further refinement of skill classification
4. **Search & Filter**: Full-text search across titles and descriptions

### When Skills Don't Exist
Current workflow for new skills:
1. User searches for a skill
2. If not found, "Create New Skill" option appears
3. User fills out skill details (title, category, description)
4. Skill is added to catalog for others to find
5. User can then add it to their profile

## Geographic & Location Features 🌍

### Current Location Support
The platform includes location functionality:

1. **User Profiles**: Store city/state location data
2. **Remote vs In-Person**: Skills can be marked as remote-friendly
3. **Location Display**: User location shown on skill cards

### NEEDED: Distance Filtering
**High Priority Enhancement Required**:

```sql
-- Add geographic coordinates to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN latitude DECIMAL(10, 8);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN longitude DECIMAL(11, 8);

-- Add distance preference to user_skills
ALTER TABLE user_skills ADD COLUMN max_distance_miles INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE user_skills ADD COLUMN location_preference TEXT CHECK (location_preference IN ('remote', 'in_person', 'both'));
```
