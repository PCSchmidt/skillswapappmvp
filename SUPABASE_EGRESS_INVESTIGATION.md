# Supabase Egress Usage Investigation & Optimization

## **Issue Identified**
High Supabase egress usage (exceeding free tier limits) with no active users.

## **Root Causes Found**

### 1. **Real-time Subscriptions (CRITICAL)**
- **Location**: `src/components/navigation/Navbar.tsx`
- **Problem**: Creates real-time WebSocket subscription on every page load
- **Impact**: Continuous data transfer even for anonymous users
- **Bandwidth**: Each subscription can transfer significant data

### 2. **Multiple Client Instances**
- Both regular and cached Supabase clients being instantiated
- Potential for duplicate connections

### 3. **Development/Testing Overhead**
- Frequent deployments and builds hitting the database
- CI/CD processes potentially consuming bandwidth

## **Immediate Fixes Implemented**

### âœ… 1. Disable Real-time for Free Tier
- Added environment flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REALTIME`
- Default to `false` for production
- Conditional real-time subscription creation

### âœ… 2. Optimize Navbar Component
- Only create subscriptions for authenticated users
- Add proper cleanup and connection management
- Fallback to polling for notification counts

### âœ… 3. Add Egress Monitoring
- Track database query patterns
- Monitor connection counts
- Log bandwidth-heavy operations

## **Budget-Friendly Architecture**

### **Free Tier Limits (Supabase)**
- Database: 50K rows, 500MB storage
- Bandwidth: 2GB egress/month
- Auth: 50,000 active users
- Edge functions: 500K invocations

### **Optimization Strategy**
1. **Disable real-time features** until paid tier
2. **Use polling** for critical updates (less frequent)
3. **Optimize queries** to reduce data transfer
4. **Implement caching** to reduce database hits
5. **Monitor usage** with built-in tracking

## **User Experience Considerations**

### **What Users Won't Notice**
- Notification counts update every 30 seconds instead of real-time
- Slightly delayed updates when data changes
- No functional features are removed

### **What Users Keep**
- Full authentication and signup
- Complete skill discovery and matching
- All interactive features
- Fast page loads and navigation

## **Migration Path to Paid Tier**

When ready to upgrade:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REALTIME=true`
2. Enable real-time features
3. Add push notifications
4. Scale database as needed

## **Testing Capacity**

With optimizations:
- **50-100 active test users** easily supported
- **Thousands of skill entries** within limits
- **Full feature testing** available
- **Performance monitoring** included

## **Next Steps**

1. âœ… Deploy egress optimizations
2. âœ… Monitor bandwidth usage
3. âœ… Test with sample users
4. ðŸ“‹ Gather user feedback
5. ðŸ“‹ Plan paid tier migration
